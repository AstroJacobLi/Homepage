# Group Meeting 2018-04-11

## Clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxy groups

assembly bias: bias between DM halo and stars.

what determines the DM halo bias? spin? substructure?

Clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxy groups may reveal DM halo distribution.

To qualify the clustering of galaxies, we introduce TWO-POINT CORRELATION FUNCTION $$\xi(r)$$. (Mo, 2010 book)

Group-galaxy cross-correlation function (Davis, Peebles, 1983). To enlarge the amount of galaxies.

Projected correlation function, eliminate redshift: wp(rp).

Two sub sample: depend on setting a threshold for halo mass. For Mhalo>13, and Mhalo<13 (depend on the brightness of galaxies.)

Here the cluster color means the color of its central galaxy.

**Red groups are more clustered than blue groups, for low mass halos (luminosity based halo mass).**

New pipeline: PYMORTH (Bernardi et al., 2017), new pipeline for luminosity. Bernardi only gives luminosity, using mass-luminosity relation (Mendel, 14), we can calculate stellar mass. "Truncated". This pipeline may have big problem, the difference between stellar mass of two catalog can be 2 dex! Luis: my 5 year old daughter can figure out .....

Offset by **GROUP FINDER** in observation: this finder assumes that the brightest galaxies are the centers of clusters.

The origin double schechter function, is not good for low mass galaxies. The mass function of SF is single schechter function. The mass function of passive galaxies is not.

# GRBs

高能的indirect detection，因为flux很小。反而低能($$<10^{14}$$ eV）的可以direct detection，因为flux很大。分界线大概是knee的位置。

对于不同component，能谱knee一下的slope是差不多的。

高能粒子的探测是通过secondary particles来进行的。越低越高，secondary particle越少，中间大气比较多。探测的是muon和其他带电粒子。

LHAASO，80000m2. 四川。

Ultra-High Energy CR, >10^18eV. can only be detected indirectly. 有两种方法：一种是用一堆telescope去观测secondary particles产生的light，另一种是用探测器array探测secondary muons。探测器array里面是一堆pure water. High-energy comes into the cavity, create cherenkov radiation. AUGER detector, very large.



UHECR cuts off at 10^20eV. E>10^20eV protons encountering a CMB photon.?????



E>10^18.5eV comes from extragalactic origin.

High energy particles can penutrate differently. Lights travels farthest. (photon can also be UHECR).



fig, pennutration.



Where does UHECR come from?

1.  AGN?? It's difficult to explain the components of rays. Rays from AGN are mainly protons.
2. High Luminosity GRBs? supernova, heavy elements emit. HL GRB also produce neutrino, but hasn't found yet.  Producer of photons maybe not the same as the producer of CR.
3. Low luminosity GRBs. source rate much higher than for HL GRBs. 



theoretical analysis requires LL GRB model.



Conclusion:

1. w2LL GRB from silicon rich progenitors, or from hypernova model can explain the Auger spectrum and composition. 

   Physical model is more important than a well-fitted model without physical meaning.
